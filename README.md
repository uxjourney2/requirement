Several researchers agree that Requirement Engineering (RE) is one of the important factors that is the critical phase of software engineering (SE). Requirements are what the system should do and explain how it should do (Hidellaarachchi et al., 2022). RE activities in traditional Software Development Methods (SDM) are detailed activities and a list of the user requirement before coding or implementation, for the modern SDM like Agile it’s something flexible and iterative (Leau et al., 2012). This modern method focuses on communication between customers and developers. Moreover, in Agile, customer involvement is important, which means the developer's interpersonal and social skills in each iteration. Hence, effective, and efficient products are delivered to the customers and enlighten the development phase. The incremental requirement in the iterative phase of Agile has given dependency issues in design, rigidity, and mobility. The first issue, rigidity means that every change in the requirement implies sequence in the other modules. And for the second issue means the inability of the system to encapsulate components that can be reused. Hence, effective collaboration is very important to conduct effective software products. Moreover, collaboration with the customers with appropriate technical skills, interpersonal skills, and understanding of customer issues that combination of this activity we call socio-technical activity. That’s activity is very important to capture the human aspect in the RE process (Baham & Hirschheim, 2022; Hidellaarachchi et al., 2022; Leau et al., 2012). <br><br>
To overcome this problem, we provide a solution with a framework called <b>UX Journey</b>. A method that combines the User Experience approach into User Requirements, to get unlimited experience from users. The following image is the flow of the <b>UX Journey</b> framework.<br>

<h2>Start with traditional approach!</h2>
Elicitation is a crucial activity in the Software Requirement due to the success of the project depends on how the developer defines the user requirement. In this repository, we have a light template and sample for the elicitation process suitable for modern software processes like Agile, Scrum, and XP. The structure of the document is seen in the following picture.<br>

<h2>Enhance with UX Journey!</h2>
By integrating user experience and user requirements in software development, various benefits can be obtained that are useful for organizations, end-users, and society in general. Therefore, integrating user experience and user requirements is important and useful in the software development process. The current research was conducted to explore answers to the main research question faced in this research, which is how the individual developer uses a socio-technical skill to understand what the user needs from the perspective of the consumer.
<h2>We are support for solo/individual/personal development!</h2>
In the context of exploring software requirements, self-efficacy plays an important role in determining how well an individual can perform a needs assessment. Someone who has high self-efficacy in extracting software requirements will be more confident in identifying and compiling end-user and business needs and ensuring that all requirements are included in the development process. By increasing self-efficacy in identifying software requirements, a person can improve their ability to effectively identify requirements and produce software that meets the needs of end-users and underlying business needs. Moreover, in solo or small software development, individual capacity is important for efficient and effective resource utilization in software development.
